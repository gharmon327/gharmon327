## [Recipe Forum](https://recipe-forum-client.onrender.com/)

 - My team and I created a recipe forum application for my final project. Food has always been a place for people to come together, so we decided to make an app that allows people to share recipes and add comments and feedback on each recipe. This app was built with react using HTML, CSS, JS, Python, and Django and is hosted on a postgresSQL database. In addition, we implemented user image input utilizing Cloudinary, a massive win for our team!

- Clowning Around is the clown-themed forum that you never knew you needed. This was my third project and is a group project that was built with the git forking workflow. It is a full-stack app that was created using the MERN stack. What started as a joke ended up being one of the most enjoyable projects I worked on. Our team added a sense of humor to our work which made it fun. We were a team of 4 and got a lot of practice working in a group environment and troubleshooting each other's code.

-This was the first project I built and was one of my two solo projects. For this project, I was able to code one of my favorite card games from growing up using HTML, vanilla JS, and CSS. This project was so much fun; with this being my first go at making a game, there was plenty of opportunity to solve problems and grow as a software engineer. In addition, doing this allowed me to dive in and solidify my passion for engineering.
